Title: An Implementation of Deep Neural Network for Regression and Classification
Description: An implementation of deep neural network with rectifier linear units (ReLU) trained
	with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method and batch normalization. A combination of these methods have
	achieved state-of-the-art performance in ImageNet classification by overcoming the gradient saturation
	problem experienced by many deep architecture neural network models in the past. In addition, batch normalization (Sergey Ioffe 2015)
	and dropout (Nitish Srivastava 2014) are implemented as regularization. The deeplearning package is inspired by
	the darch package and uses its class DArch.
